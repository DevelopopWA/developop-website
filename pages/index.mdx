# Welcome to DeveloPop!

## What is DeveloPop?

We are a team of about 10 students from schools around Washington state collarborating to build a platform for young scholars to pursue their coding passions. Developop has well structured lessons to teach app development for Android and IOS from beginning to end. Along with videos, we have structured our content so that there are follow-along projects which will often have challenges that students will complete themselves and then check their work by a tutorial.
